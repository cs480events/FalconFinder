 ith colleagues into meaningful moments of genuine exchange.\n\n \n\nRegistr

DESCRIPTION:Author David Gessner and Local Conservationist Dan Driscoll wil
 l take the stage to recount the stories and share their ideas about falling
  in love with something natural\, as Dan did with the Charles\, and “fighti
 ng like hell for it.”\n\nIn 2011\, author David Gessner published My Green 
 Manifesto\, a chronology of his canoe trip down the Charles River with Dan 
 Driscoll\, the state-agency man responsible for making the Charles the gem 
 that it is today. On their multi-day journey enjoying the sights and sounds
  of the river from source to mouth\, they discuss the challenges Dan faced 
 while fighting for the watercourse made famous by the song Dirty Water\, an
 d attempt to identify the tenets of new environmentalism.

DESCRIPTION:How do we manage conversations when the stakes are high\, opini
 ons vary\, and emotions run hot? These exchanges are both difficult and cru
 cial\, and as such\, they require a truthful\, authentic\, and respectful a
 pproach. However\, it is precisely in times of stress that conversations ar
 e most apt to devolve into arguments. In this workshop we will use mindfuln
 ess practice to bring grounded\, aware presence to the ways we interact wit
 h each other\, and learn simple tricks that foster constructive exchanges f
 or wise decision-making.\n\n \n\nRegistration is limited and will be confir
 med by email.\nPease click here to register.
